# My Red bot cogs
This repository will contain all of the cogs that I have created for the Red Discord bot of a club. I do not want to give the code of the bot, so my contributions will be displayed here.

# Currently have
Bracket.py

# Plans
Currently Bracket.py was created for 1 server. I will change it later so that it can be configured so any server can use it.
